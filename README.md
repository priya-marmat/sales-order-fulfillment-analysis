## 📌 1. Project Title  
**Sales and Order Fulfillment Analysis with Predictive Modeling**

# 🎯 2. Purpose  
The goal of this project is to analyze sales and order data to uncover valuable business insights and fulfillment trends, and to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether an order will be shipped or not. The insights aim to support stakeholders in making data-driven decisions.

## 🛠️ 3. Technologies Used  
- **Excel** – Initial data cleaning and transformation  
- **MySQL** – Data storage in SQL  
- **Python** – Data preprocessing, EDA, and machine learning  
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `seaborn`  
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard creation  

## 📂 4. Data Source  
- Sample **Sales Data CSV** file containing:  
  - Order details  
  - Shipment status  
  - Customer and product info  
  - Dates and pricing  
- Cleaned using Excel and loaded into MySQL for further analysis.
- 
# 🌟 5. Key Features & Highlights  
- Created a **Power BI dashboard** showing KPIs like:
- Total Sales, Total Orders, Average Order Value  
- Sales by Product Line, Region, and Order Status  
- Built a **classification model** in Python using RandomForest to predict whether an order will be shipped  
- Achieved over **90% model accuracy** on the test data  
-  Applied **one-hot encoding** and a **Pipeline** approach for preprocessing  
-  Delivered insights to support:
- Better logistics planning  
- Inventory management  
- Proactive handling of high-risk (unshipped) orders  
# Machine Learning Summary  
**Model Type**: Random Forest Classifier  
**Target Variable**: `STATUS` (Shipped / Not Shipped)  
**Accuracy**: ~90%  
**Tools Used**: `pandas`, `sklearn`, `ColumnTransformer`, `Pipeline`
